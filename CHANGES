Version 0.2 - 14/06/2013
------------------------

Some basic schedulers have been implemented (Single device, Round-Robin,
Eager). Data transfers are automatically performed before kernel execution.
Note that memory reclaiming is not yet implemented.

LispSOCL is the most complete example. Several OpenCL kernels are available
(add, sub, potrf, mul, transpose). Parallel reduction of a list is supported
with "List.reduce".


Version 0.1 - 31/05/2013
------------------------

First alpha release. A basic Lisp parser is implemented. Parallel graph
reduction is implemented and support built-ins allowing us to replace a
reduction by an IO. LispCL example executes an OpenCL kernel when an "add"
application is to be reduced.
